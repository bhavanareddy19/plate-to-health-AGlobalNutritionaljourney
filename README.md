Plate-to-Health: A Global Nutritional Journey
**Plate-to-Health: A Global Nutritional Journey** explores the relationship between diet and health across various demographics worldwide. Using data from the Global Dietary Database (GDD), it examines how factors like age, gender, and education influence dietary habits over time. The study aims to uncover disparities in nutrition and identify trends in the consumption of key vitamins and nutrients. By addressing gaps such as cultural influences, policy impacts, and micronutrient deficiencies, the project seeks to inform targeted health interventions and promote equitable public health strategies globally.
